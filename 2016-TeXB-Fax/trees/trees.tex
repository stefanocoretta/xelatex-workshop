\documentclass[border=.2cm, convert]{standalone}

% the "convert" option above produces a .png image. For this option to work, though, tou need to go in Preferences > Commands and change the XeLaTeX command to "/Library/TeX/texbin/xelatex -shell-escape -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode %.tex". This adds "-shell-escape" which means that the pdf file is "passed" onto the shell (the Terminal app): there, the command "convert" is executed. Sorry if it's a bit technical, you can write to me if you have problems or if you wanna know more about it. :)

% Now you can compile normally (clicking on the double green triangle button)
